Tasks:

1. Describe the dataset using any appropriate descriptive statistics and visuals.
2. Develop a theoretical model, based on prior research, of how house prices are determined based on house features.
3. Test, using linear regression, your proposed theoretical model to explain house prices and analyse the findings.
4. Run all suitable diagnostic tests on the regression specification, making improvements to the regression specification where necessary. Discuss the issues and changes made.
